## Project Goals

Horiseon Social Solutions requested a code refactoring of their website to meet accesibility standards. 

## Why refactor Code?

Refactoring code to make a website more accesible will help people with disabilities navigate through a webpage much easier. The benefits of having a website that meets accesibility standards will also help Horiseon Social Solutions rank higher in a google search.

## How to refactor Code?

I succesfully replaced certain HTML tags with semantic HTML elements. This helped me consolidate repetitive CSS elements. I added descriptive alt attributes for all the images on the webpage. I also added comments in my CSS file to explain the code and to help edit it in the 
future if needed. See examples below.

# Motivation

I enjoyed helping Horiseon Social Solutions refactor the code for their website. I learned some new skills and worked through some challenges that will help me be successful when working on future problems and projects.
